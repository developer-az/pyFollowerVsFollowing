### Hi!ðŸ‘‹ This is my repository for my Python project that helps find who unfollowed or has stopped following you on Instagram.
<h2>Youtube video tutorial link: https://youtu.be/ZugkbNARgnU </h2>

In order to use this, please download the folder. Then remove the given example "following.html" and "followers_1.html" files in the folder and replace them with your own personal "following.html" and "followers_1.html" files given from Instagram. Then with the use of the "followerfollowing.py" python file, the terminal will output the number of people who do not follow you back and list out their usernames for you.
