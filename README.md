### Hi!ðŸ‘‹ This is my repository for my Python project that helps you find those who unfollowed or have stopped following your account on Instagram.
<h2>Youtube video tutorial link: https://youtu.be/ZugkbNARgnU </h2>

INSTRUCTIONS: 
  <br><br>-Please download the code zip file, then extract all to get the pyFollowerVsFollowing folder. 
  <br><br>-Remove the given example "following.html" and "followers_1.html" files from the pyFollowerVsFollowing folder.
 <br><br>-Put your own personal "following.html" and "followers_1.html" files given from Instagram into the pyFollowerVsFollowing folder 
  <br><br> (To find this: Download your data from Instagram (through: https://accountscenter.instagram.com/info_and_permissions/?theme=dark) then, extract the zip file into a folder, open that folder, and go in connections -> followers-and-following, and your personal "following.html" and "followers_1.html" files will be found there.) 
 <br> <br>-With the import of the personalized pyFollowerVsFollowing folder into your chosen IDE, run the followerfollowing.py file.
  
  <h5>The terminal will then output the number of people who do not follow you back and list out their usernames for you.</h5>
