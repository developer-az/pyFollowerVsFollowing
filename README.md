### Hi!ðŸ‘‹ This is my repository for my Python project that helps find who unfollowed or has stopped following you on Instagram.
<h2>Youtube video tutorial link: https://youtu.be/ZugkbNARgnU </h2>

In order to use this: 
  <br>-Please download the code zip file, then extract all to get the folder. 
  <br>-Remove the given example "following.html" and "followers_1.html" files in the folder 
  <br>-replace them with your own personal "following.html" and "followers_1.html" files given from Instagram. 
  <br>-With the import of the pyFollowerVsFollowing colder, in conjunction with your chosen IDE, run the followerfollowing.py file.
  
  <h5>The terminal will then output the number of people who do not follow you back and list out their usernames for you.</h5>
